### Based in the US

We are a hardworking team who have always had a passion for games. At some stage, our inspiration transitioned us from playing to creating. We aspire to fill gaps in the market, predominantly in the narrative adventure space.

#### As diversity is important in modern teams,

We have diversity in gender, ethnicity, and thought. Our team has formal professional qualifications in commerce and computer science, along with years of working knowledge in the corporate realm.

While we are currently based in the US, our team has lived in and traveled to several countries, including Australia, India, the EU, the Middle East, and Japan. This experience has given us a global mindset and understanding of diverse regions.

We hope to bring people all around the world closer through our games, whether through cooperative play or a shared love of a story.
