### Based in the US

We are a hard working team who have always had a passion for games. At some stage, our inspiration transitioned us from playing to creating. We aspire to fill gaps in the market predominantly in the narrative adventure space.

#### As it is important in modern teams,

We have diversity in the way of gender, ethnicity and thought. Our team has formal professional qualifications in commerce and computer science along with years of working knowledge in the corporate realm.

While we are currently based in the US, our team have lived in and traveled to several countries including the Australia, India, EU, Middle East and Japan which has given us a global mindset and an understanding of different regions. 

We hope to bring people all around the world closer through our games, whether it be through cooperative play or shared love of a story.

**What's better than one founder?**

Two co-founders:

Melissa Koven and Awal Premi.
